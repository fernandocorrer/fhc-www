# Exploring the 1.	National Center for Biotechnology Information website

The [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (NCBI) is a valuable resource for  biomedical and genomic information. It is located in Bethesda (MD) and is founded in 1988 as a division of the [National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/socialmedia/index.html) (NLM), the largest biomedical library and part of the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov) (NIH). 


The NCBI houses a series of databases relevant to biotechnology and biomedicine and is an important resource for bioinformatics tools and services. Major databases include GenBank for DNA sequences and PubMed, a bibliographic database for the biomedical literature (Wikipedia). BLAST is another important feature of NCBI that we would use in a subsequent web activity.

Exercise:

1.	Explore the various features of NCBI and look for the function of your favorite gene. Please explain your search (you can include pictures). In addition, read and comment in forum at least one paper about the gene you chose.
