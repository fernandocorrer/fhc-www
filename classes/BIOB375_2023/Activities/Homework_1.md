# Exploring the 1.	National Center for Biotechnology Information website

The [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (NCBI) is one of main sources of information. It is part of the United States [National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/socialmedia/index.html) (NLM), a branch of the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov) (NIH), founded in 1988 through legislation sponsored by Senator Claude Pepper and located in Bethesda, Maryland. The NCBI houses a series of databases relevant to biotechnology and biomedicine and is an important resource for bioinformatics tools and services. Major databases include GenBank for DNA sequences and PubMed, a bibliographic database for the biomedical literature (Wikipedia). BLAST is another important feature of NCBI that we would use in a subsequent web activity.

Exercise:

1.	Explore the various features of NCBI and look for the function of your favorite gene. Please explain your search (you can include pictures). In addition, read and comment in forum at least one paper about the gene you chose.
