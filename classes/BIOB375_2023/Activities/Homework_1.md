# Exploring the 1.	National Center for Biotechnology Information website

The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is part of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM), a branch of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), founded in 1988 through legislation sponsored by Senator Claude Pepper and located in Bethesda, Maryland. The NCBI houses a series of databases relevant to biotechnology and biomedicine and is an important resource for bioinformatics tools and services. Major databases include GenBank for DNA sequences and PubMed, a bibliographic database for the biomedical literature (Wikipedia). BLAST is another important feature of NCBI that we would use in a subsequent web activity.
