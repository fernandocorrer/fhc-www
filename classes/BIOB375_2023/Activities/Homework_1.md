## Exploring the National Center for Biotechnology Information website

The [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (NCBI) is a valuable resource for  biomedical and genomic information. It is located in Bethesda (MD) and is founded in 1988 as a division of the [National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/socialmedia/index.html) (NLM), the largest biomedical library and part of the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov) (NIH). On the NCBI website we can find multiple databases relevant to research in Genetics, being a important resource for Bioinformatics. There are two other very relevant sources of information: [DDBJ](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/) and [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/). Together with NCBI they form the [International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration](https://www.insdc.org) (INSDC), creating a synchronized database where we can find data from multiple experiments - from raw reads to complete details about studies.

Let's explore!
