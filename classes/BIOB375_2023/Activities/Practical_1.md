## Mendelian Genetics

### Exercise 1 

You received ears of corn with smooth and wrinkled seeds from an F2 generation. The gene **Su** in recessive condition (*su su*) (sugary endosperm) results in wrinkled seeds. After counting the number of seeds in each category, use the Chi-square test to analyze if your data follows the expectations for an F2 generation considering a single gene where one allele showing dominance over the other.

After counting the number of seeds in each category, fill out the table. Remember that for the case we are testing, the expected ratio is 3:1. Then, let's calculate the $\chi^2$ :

| Category | Observed frequency (fo) | Expected frequency (fe) | $\(fo - fe\)$ | $\(fo - fe\)^2$ | $\[\(fo - fe\)^2\]/\(fe\)$ |
|----------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Normal   |                         | 3/4n                    |             |               |                      |
| Wrinkled |                         | 1/2n                    |             |               |                      |
|          |  (n)                    |                         |             | -             | $\chi^2$=            |



### Exercise 2

Similarly, count the number of i) purple and smooth; ii) purple and wrinkled; iii) yellow and smooth; iv) yellow and wrinkled. Consider that the gene **Y** is responsible for seed color and that **Y** encodes for a purple and **y** for yellow. Those ears also come from an F2 generation. Analyze your data using the Chi-square test (expected ratio for two traits controlled by independent genes).
