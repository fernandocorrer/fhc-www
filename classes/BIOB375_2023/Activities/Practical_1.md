## Mendelian Genetics

### Exercise 1 

You received ears of corn with smooth and wrinkled seeds from an F2 generation. The gene **Su** in recessive condition (*su su*) (sugary endosperm) results in wrinkled seeds. After counting the number of seeds in each category, use the Chi-square test to analyze if your data follows the expectations for an F2 generation.

### Exercise 2

Similarly, count the number of i) purple and smooth; ii) purple and wrinkled; iii) yellow and smooth; iv) yellow and wrinkled. Consider that the gene **Y** is responsible for seed color and that **Y** encodes for a purple and **y** for yellow. Those ears also come from an F2 generation. Analyze your data using the Chi-square test (expected ratio for two traits controlled by independent genes).
