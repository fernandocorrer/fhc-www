title: Nice to meet you!

I'm Fernando Correr, a Post-doctoral Researcher in the [Plant Science and Plant Pathology Department](https://plantsciences.montana.edu) at Montana State University under the supervision of [Prof. Jennifer Lachowiec](https://plantsciences.montana.edu/directory/faculty/2030327/jennifer-lachowiec).   

I started working with Plant Genetics during my undergrad studies in Biotechnology at the Federal University of São Carlos. At that time I was fascinated with Science and I had the opportunity of knowwing more about physicochemical characterization of sugar, Botany and Genetics. Working on latter area made me pursue an internship at the [Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture](http://www.en.esalq.usp.br) (University of São Paulo). There I obtained a masters and a PhD degree in Genetics and Plant Breeding under the supervision of [Prof. Gabriel Rodrigues Alves Margarido](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6dT3GmUAAAAJ&hl=en). My work focused mostly on Plant Bioinformatics, investigating gene expression profiles in accessions of the genus *Saccharum*.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy being in contact with nature, drawing, cooking and cultivating plants!
